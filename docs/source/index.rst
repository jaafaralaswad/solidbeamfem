solidbeamFEM Documentation
=========================

Nonlinear finite element solver in Python for beams modeled as continua using brick elements in convected curvilinear coordinates. It alleviates geometry-induced locking modes (membrane, transverse shear, and curvature–thickness locking) using the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) method. Locking modes can be alleviated selectively to identify which modes are responsible for the observed locking behavior. The solver also supports comparisons with alternative techniques such as h- and p-refinement and reduced integration rules.
